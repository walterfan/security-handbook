# Identity and Access Management (IAM)
IAM is a service that provides identity and access management for AWS services. It allows you to create and manage users, groups, roles, and policies.

IAM provides fine-grained access control to AWS resources, allowing you to grant or deny access to specific actions and resources based on the user's identity and permissions.
